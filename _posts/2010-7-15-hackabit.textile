Last night the folks at "bit.ly":http://bit.ly hosted a hackathon, called "hackabit":http://hackabit.com, to celebrate their 2nd anniversary (congratulations guys!). It was awesome; there were a bunch of us there from "10gen":http://www.10gen.com, the bit.ly people are great, and it was fun just hanging out and working on stuff. There was a lot of coding being done, but I don't have links to much of it (one cool project was a Python "url normalization library":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/urlnorm by Jehiah). If anybody has links to other projects people were working on, let me know.

I wanted to do "yet":/2007/11/zoomix-another-javascript-game.html "another":/2007/06/fun-game.html quick JS game, and also wanted to do something bit.ly themed. The result is "be bit.ly":/bebitly - a game where you play the role of the bit.ly website, by shortening incoming urls and turning shortened urls back into long ones. It sounds a bit strange, but I think it came out okay - hope you enjoy it! I know there are some rough edges, but time was short. Let me know what you think in the comments.
