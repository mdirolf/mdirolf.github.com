I don't think I've mentioned it here, but a few months ago "Kristina":http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/ and I finished writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449381561?ie=UTF8&tag=mikdir-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449381561">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mikdir-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449381561" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. Writing the book was a big undertaking, and for a while it seemed like it would take a miracle just to finish it on time. Well, to make a long story short, the book is finished and it's on the shelves.

I have a couple of extra copies of TDG that have been collecting dust in my apartment, and, after tripping over them for the past two months, I've decided to give them away! There are three copies up for grabs, each of which will be signed by me (and hopefully by Kristina too, if I see her soon enough). To enter the contest, leave a note in the comments with your name _and_ the name of your favorite restaurant. In a week or so I'll (randomly) select the winners and announce them in another post. I'll pay for shipping in the US, but if you're in a different country I'll probably ask you to foot that bill. Good luck!
