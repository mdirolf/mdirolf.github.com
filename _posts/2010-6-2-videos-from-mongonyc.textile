title: Videos from _MongoNYC_
summary: MongoNYC happened in the end of May and was one of my favorite conferences of the past year. All of the talks I went to were very good, and I also got to talk to a ton of interesting people. The videos from the conference were just posted - I've embedded the videos of my talks and linked to a couple others I thought were great.

"MongoNYC":http://www.10gen.com/event_mongony_10may21 happened in the end of May and was one of my favorite conferences of the past year. All of the talks I went to were very good, and I also got to talk to a ton of interesting people. The videos from the conference were just posted, and they can all be found "here":http://mongodb.blip.tv/. The two talks I did are embedded below, but I'd also recommend checking out "Kushal's":http://blip.tv/file/3701052 and "Jay's":http://blip.tv/file/3704043 talks.
