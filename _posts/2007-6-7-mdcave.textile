title: _MDCave_ -- A _JavaScript Game_
permalink: /2007/06/fun-game.html
summary: In lieu of a real post here's a time-waster for those I haven't showed already. This is a game I wrote to procrastinate about a month or two ago, meant to be a larger version of "this game":http://www.sfcave.com/javaCave.php. It should work in Safari and Firefox. Also, cut me some slack for the lack of polish, as it really was a one night affair. The whole thing is written using Apple's canvas tag and JavaScript, feel free to use the "source":http://github.com/mdirolf/mdcave for whatever you want. Post your high scores in the comments.

p(note). Updated 2009-12-13: Adding the actual game itself to this page, mainly so that Aaron has a place to play. Also changing the title to *MDCave -- A JavaScript Game* from *A Fun Game*.
