title: Videos from _MongoNYC_
summary: MongoNYC happened in the end of May and was one of my favorite conferences of the past year. All of the talks I went to were very good, and I also had a chance to meet and talk with a ton of interesting people. The videos from the conference were just posted - I've embedded the videos of my talks and linked to a couple others I thought were great.

[MongoNYC](http://www.10gen.com/event_mongony_10may21) happened in the
end of May and was one of my favorite conferences of the past year. All
of the talks I went to were very good, and I also had a chance to meet
and talk with a ton of interesting people. The videos from the
conference were just posted, and they can all be found
[here](http://mongodb.blip.tv/). The two talks I did are embedded below,
but Iâ€™d also recommend checking out at least the talks by
[Kushal](http://blip.tv/file/3701052) and
[Jay](http://blip.tv/file/3704043).
