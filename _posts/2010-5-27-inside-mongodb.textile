p(note). Updated 2010-10-29: There is now video of this talk (from when it was given at Mongo Boston) available "here":http://www.10gen.com/video/mongoboston2010/mongodbinternals.

This year at "Gluecon":http://www.gluecon.com/2010/ I was asked to speak about MongoDB, and specifically to give a "very technical" talk about it. I realized that this would be a good opportunity to do a talk other than the usual "introduction to MongoDB":/2010/04/09/introduction-to-mongodb.html and decided speak about MongoDB internals. Here's the deck I used:

<div align=center><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=internals-100527122106-phpapp02&stripped_title=inside-mongodb-the-internals-of-an-opensource-database" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=internals-100527122106-phpapp02&stripped_title=inside-mongodb-the-internals-of-an-opensource-database" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>

If you have any questions or interest in hearing more about this (perhaps a series of blog posts on MongoDB internals?), let me know in the comments!
