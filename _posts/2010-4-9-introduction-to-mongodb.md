title: _Introduction_ to _MongoDB_
summary: The "Intro to MongoDB" deck that I presented at PhillyETE, as well as some brief thoughts on the conference.
---

I just finished giving a presentation introducing MongoDB at
[PhillyETE](http://phillyemergingtech.com/). Here’s the deck I used; I
think video will be available soon and I’ll post that when it’s up:

I think the presentation went well, and overall the conference was
great. My favorite talk (besides the MongoDB one, of course) was one by
[Geir](http://twitter.com/geirmagnusson). His talk was ostensibly about
Project Voldemort, but ended up being more about infrastructure at
[Gilt](http://www.gilt.com/) and the myriad approaches they’ve taken to
tackling their unique traffic patterns - very entertaining stuff.

If you have any questions lingering from the presentation at PhillyETE,
or about MongoDB in general, pipe up in the comments!
