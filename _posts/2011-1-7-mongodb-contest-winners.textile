It has been about a week since I announced that I was "giving away":/2010/12/30/mongodb-the-definitive-guide-giveaway.html of copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449381561?ie=UTF8&tag=mikdir-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449381561">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mikdir-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1449381561" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. So, it's time to announce the winners!

I did a random drawing of the people who commented on the post (only including those who actually listed their favorite restaurant!). The winners are (drum roll):

* Rob D (Robdoherty2)
* Shehab Hamad
* Sam Sen

If you're one of the winners, please send me an email (address is in the header of this site) with your address and we'll figure out how to get you your copy! If you didn't win, don't lose all hope: if any of the winners don't pipe up within the next week, I'll pick a new name. If all the prizes are claimed, or they aren't but you still don't win, send me an email and I'll set you up with a nice discount on the book (contest participants only, please).

Thanks for playing!
