I'm a software engineer working at "10gen":http://www.10gen.com on "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org. I try to play as much "soccer":http://www.barnstonworth.com/ as possible and am also always up for riding (or building) "longboards":http://www.loudonvillelongboards.com/. Born and raised in "Albany":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/albany/clusters/empire-plaza-state/, I'm now living in "New York":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/nyc/clusters/newyorkcity-manhattan-city/ (after a brief stint in "New Jersey":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/princeton/clusters/newjersey-nj-university/).
