I'm a software engineer. I've been pretty involved with "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org. I try to play as much soccer as possible and am also always up for riding (or building) "longboards":http://loudonvillelongboards.com/. Born and raised in "Albany":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/albany/clusters/empire-plaza-state/, I'm now living in "New York":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/nyc/clusters/newyorkcity-manhattan-city/.
