<h2>Albany's Tax Problem</h2>



<img src="/images/two-buildings.png" class="pure-img"/>



<p>Many residents of Albany would recognize the building at 759 Madison Ave on sight. What was once an impressive structure on one of Albany's most important streets is now in ruins. The next four buildings up Madison (761-773) are all in much better shape and are still actively used and maintained.</p>



<p>It's clear that 759 Madison is an example of what we don't want to see in our city: a building that has been left to rot and a property that is going unused. What's less obvious, however, is that our city policy is actively encouraging this kind of abandonment. The tax assessment of 759 Madison is $35,000, while the four well maintained neighbors are assessed at between $225,000 and $360,000. That stark difference is because our assessments (and tax bills) include the value of the buildings on a property. When buildings are well maintained the tax assessment is high, and when they're rotting or demolished the tax assessment is low. Our tax structure incentivizes exactly the type of behavior that we don't want to see: we give tax breaks to properties that are vacant or underused.</p>



<p>What if, instead, we were to tax based on the underlying value of a property's land, and not include the value of the buildings? Since 759 Madison and it's neighbors all have similarly sized lots on the same block, their tax bills would now be roughly equal. The owner of 759 Madison would now be paying much more - that would give them a strong incentive to either rehab the building, put the property to other productive use, or sell it to somebody who would. The owners of the neighboring buildings would get a tax break, which can be thought of as a reward for using land productively.</p>



<p>By taxing land value alone, the city would add a development and maintenance incentive to every single property citywide. Assessments would be easier to reason about, since assigning value to land is inherently less subjective than assigning value to both land and any buildings. The oft-maligned IDA (development agency that gives out tax breaks for large projects) would become redundant, since large redevelopment projects would already have built-in tax incentives. Owners of well-maintained homes and commercial properties would get a break in their taxes that they so desperately need.</p>



<p>While this may seem like a radical idea for Albany, it's not without precedent. Similar systems have proven effective in cities of all sizes, from Harrisburg, PA to Singapore. I encourage residents of Albany to explore this idea further and ask their elected representatives to do the same.</p>
